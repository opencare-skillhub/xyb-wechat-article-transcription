description: Download or read a WeChat public account article, rewrite it into an xyb-style WeChat HTML article, and save the final HTML to an absolute path. Use when the user provides an mp.weixin.qq.com link or a local article file and wants a complete transcribe->rewrite->HTML output chain with template selection, defaulting to template1 morandi purple unless the user chooses otherwise.

# XYB WeChat Transcribe

Use this skill to turn a WeChat article into an xyb-style公众号 HTML output.

## Input modes

Accept either:
- a `mp.weixin.qq.com` article URL, or
- a local file path containing HTML, MD, or text.

If the input is a WeChat URL, download the article first with the bundled downloader logic. Do not ask the user to run another skill.

## Flow

1. Detect whether the input is a URL or a local file path.
2. If URL, download HTML and MD via the remote MCP downloader.
3. Read the source content and extract the article title, summary, and body from the full `js_content` DOM.
4. Ask for template family if not already specified. Default to `template1`.
5. Ask for color style if not already specified. Default to `morandi_purple`.
6. If the user wants raw original article element retention, use template style 3; otherwise use the preset template elements.
6. Ask for rewrite requirements if not already specified, including the desired tone or extra emphasis.
7. Rewrite the article for公众号 readability while preserving factual data.
8. Render the article into the chosen xyb template.
9. Save the HTML and return the absolute file path for review.

## Template selection

Default to `template1` + `xyb_template_morandi_purple.html`.

Available template families:
- `template1`: the standard xyb card-style layout used by `xyb-wechat-article-generator`
- `template2`: the special xyb feature-story layout used by `xyb-wechat-article-generator`
- `template3`: the raw-article element retention layout, preserving original WeChat section structure while still applying xyb color and output rules

Available styles:
- `morandi_purple` (default)
- `morandi_green`
- `raw_original`

Interaction rule:
- If the user has not explicitly chosen a family or style, prompt for both in one step and continue with the defaults if they accept.
- If the user has not specified rewrite requirements, prompt for a short rewrite brief and continue after collecting it.

If the user does not specify the template family or style, ask them to choose from the two families and the two styles, then continue.

## Rewrite requirements

Always preserve:
- factual data
- names
- dates
- percentages
- trial numbers
- paper conclusions

Allowed rewrite actions:
- make the language easier for公众号 readers
- reorganize long paragraphs into sections
- add brief explanation around technical terms
- keep key medical terms bold

Do not invent new data or claims.

USP cover subtitle rule:
- generate a content-derived 8-character hook
- format must be exactly `4字·4字`
- the separator must be the middle dot `·`
- never use a period `.`, template name, or workflow label in that position
- prefer tense, contrasting, title-derived phrases over safe generic wording
- if the title contains a clear conflict or pain point, extract that conflict into the hook

Template selection rule:
- `template1` and `template2` should use preset template elements, not the original article's section structure
- `template3` is the only mode that preserves the original article element structure and only applies xyb color/output conventions

Body boundary rule:
- Use subtractive cleanup when the original WeChat `js_content` is available.
- Preserve the article body from the title/content start, including non-ad inline images and tables.
- Stop the body at the first tail-operation marker and drop that node plus everything after it.
- Tail markers include recommendation blocks, online-visit guide blocks, account promotion blocks, author/editor bylines, and tiny decorative boundary images that introduce footer content.
- For the Fudan Cancer Hospital template family, the tiny image URL containing `O4S31l7wCFJqWpeLPjziaibleMm4WF2WPjUSIN3yXNyMsdrTQFuxEy7mDpNJVLtAcXRnJicc1wJlXHd21XLrr0E1RUnPsCfV8KNwtuPYqmiaBnA` is a hard footer boundary; remove it and all following content.
- Do not keep tail text such as `在线就诊指南`, `近期热文`, `有爱不惧癌`, `撰文：`, or `编辑：`.

## Output

Write one HTML file and report:
- the absolute output path
- the selected template family
- the selected style
- the source input path or URL
- the extracted title and summary

## Implementation note

Use the bundled script in `scripts/render.py` for downloading, reading, rewriting, and rendering.
